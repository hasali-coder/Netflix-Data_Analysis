# Netflix Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains data analysis and visualization work related to Netflix content using Python and various data science libraries.

## Overview

- **Data**: The `data` directory contains the Netflix dataset (`cleaned_netflix_data.csv`) and the geospatial dataset from Natural Earth (`ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp`) used for geospatial analysis.

- **Notebooks**: The `notebooks` directory includes Jupyter Notebook files (`netflix_analysis.ipynb`, `geospatial_analysis.ipynb`) that demonstrate data analysis, visualization, and geospatial analysis using the provided datasets.

## Notebooks

1. [Netflix Data Analysis](notebooks/netflix_analysis.ipynb): This notebook explores and analyzes the Netflix dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), content similarity, time series analysis, anomaly detection, and content popularity prediction.

2. [Geospatial Analysis](notebooks/geospatial_analysis.ipynb): This notebook focuses on geospatial analysis using the Netflix dataset and a geospatial dataset from Natural Earth. It includes content availability visualization by country.
